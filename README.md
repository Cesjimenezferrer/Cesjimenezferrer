- 🌱 I’m constantly expanding my knowledge in **Power BI** and experimenting with various **programming tools** to enhance my data analysis skills.
- 📊 My work includes designing **interactive dashboards in Tableau**, optimizing processes with **Alteryx**, and manipulating large datasets in **Excel** to turn data into actionable insights.

- 🐶 Fun fact 2: I'm a dog lover with two awesome pups—one looks like a wolf, and the other is a wiener dog. Together, they bring a perfect mix of fierceness and adorableness!
